Add a few more hallucinatory liquids.
Alignment record has a lower bound of -70 and an upper bound of +30.
Alignment record increases much more slowly from killing monsters.
When offering the Amulet of Yendor to Moloch while hallucinating, a somewhat
different message is displayed.

General New Features
--------------------
T-shirts are more interesting, with multiple colors and multiple types of
  inscriptions (text, image, or none at all).
  (Note to self: there is a hard limit of 256 messages of either type, and
  a hard limit of 64 colors)
Creepers can now spawn. Anyone who played Minecraft will know what it can do.
Sentient mochi: they have a nasty bite attack so it would be best to steer
  away from them
Arch-newts: curse potions, but eating their corpses gives a moderate energy
  boost
