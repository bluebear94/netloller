## NetLoller

NetLoller is a variant of NetHack based on 3.6.1. It aims to provide fun and
challenge, without too steep of a difficulty curve (I've yet to ascend in
vanilla).

(Originally, I intended on using JNetHack 3.6.0-5, but it proved too hard
  to make it be aware of UTF-8.)

### Changes

See fixes60.0.
